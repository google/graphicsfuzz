## Coverage-guided mutation-based fuzzing for WebGPU

### Description

[WebGPU](https://gpuweb.github.io/gpuweb/) is an upcoming standard for exposing the capabilities of GPU hardware in web browsers. Since WebGPU will be implemented in all major browsers it is vital that its implementation is secure.

WebGPU features a new shading language, [WGSL](https://gpuweb.github.io/gpuweb/wgsl.html) (the WebGPU Shading Language). Shader programs in WebGPU content will be written in WGSL, and translated to an appropriate platform-specific shading language by the web browser. For example, it is likely that a WGSL shader will be translated into Apple's Metal shading language if Safari is being used on a Mac or iPhone, to Microsoft's High Level Shading Language (HLSL) on Windows, or to the Vulkan SPIR-V shading language on Android or Linux.

[Tint](https://dawn.googlesource.com/tint/) is an open source implementation of WGSL, and part of the Chromium project. The focus of the proposed GSoC project is on using coverage-guided mutation-based fuzzing to achieve high test coverage of Tint, with the aim of revealing faults and vulnerabilities that can be fixed. The project will involve using [LibFuzzer](https://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html) to automatically fuzz Tint. LibFuzzer supports writing *custom mutators* that mutate a test case in a domain-specific fashion, so a key focus of the project will be designing and implementing Tint-specific custom mutators.

In the past, our team has developed fuzzing tools for the SPIR-V and GLSL shading languages - [spirv-fuzz](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-Tools#fuzzer) and [glsl-fuzz](https://github.com/google/graphicsfuzz). One approach could be to design custom mutators that leverage these existing tools, exploiting the fact that compiler pathways from GLSL and SPIR-V to WGSL exist. Another approach could be to write brand new custom mutators that work directly on WGSL source code or on the Tint intermediate representation.

### Expected outcomes

The project would deliver either or both of:

- LibFuzzer custom mutators for WGSL based on the existing spirv-fuzz or glsl-fuzz fuzzing tools
- Brand new LibFuzzer custom mutators that operate on WGSL (or the Tint intermediate representation) directly

In addition, the project would probably lead to finding and reporting several bugs in the open source Tint project, as well as making general improvements to the spirv-fuzz or glsl-fuzz tools.



### Required skills

- Strong C++ programming skills are an essential prerequisite for the project.

A student with existing experience with compiler frameworks, with knowledge of graphics shading languages, or with experience of using LibFuzzer, would have a head start, but these are not the required skills.



### Possible mentors

Alastair Donaldson (primary), Paul Thomson (secondary).



### Difficulty rating

Medium.



## Improving support for compute shaders in GraphicsFuzz or spirv-fuzz

### Description

[GraphicsFuzz](https://github.com/google/graphicsfuzz) is a mature tool (written in Java) for automatically finding bugs in OpenGL ES graphics drivers.  It was the basis of two successful 2019 GSoC projects, by Abel Briggs and Jiradet Ounjai.

[spirv-fuzz](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-Tools#fuzzer) is a mature tool (written in C++) for automatically finding bugs in Vulkan graphics drivers.  It was the basis of two successful 2020 GSoC projects, by Vasyl Teliman and André Perez Maselco.

Both tools work by taking an existing shader, parsing it, mutating it, and outputting a much more complex “variant” shader that should have the same behavior as the original. The variant shader is harder for the graphics driver to process and can lead to crashes or the wrong image being rendered. The approach involves applying a series of semantics-preserving transformations to the shader to make it very different from the shader compiler's perspective, but to preserve the result that it produces.  This means that bugs can be found by comparing the image rendered by an original shader and a transformed variant of that shader.

Currently GraphicsFuzz and spirv-fuzz are both heavily tailored towards transforming *fragment shaders*. The tools have limited support for *compute shaders*, which are interesting because they feature concurrent computation with multiple workgroups, the use of atomic operations to modify shared memory, barrier operations to synchronise threads, and fence operations to synchronise memory. This project would involve adding new transformations to either or both of these tools to improve their support for compute shaders.



### Expected outcomes

A successful project in this area would involve making a series of pull requests to [GraphicsFuzz](https://github.com/google/graphicsfuzz) or [spirv-fuzz](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-Tools#fuzzer) to contribute features that improve the manner in which these tools support compute shaders.

Throughout the project, the student would test their contributions by running GraphicsFuzz on a range of OpenGL and Vulkan graphics drivers.  This would likely lead to the discovery of a number of bugs that could be reported to open source Vulkan projects, such as [Mesa](https://www.mesa3d.org/) and [SwiftShader](https://github.com/google/swiftshader).



### Required skills

Strong C++ or Java programming skills are an essential prerequisite.

Some familiarity with compiler frameworks and/or graphics programming models would give the student a head start, but are not required.



### Possible mentors

Alastair Donaldson (primary).  Paul Thomson (secondary).



### Difficulty rating

Medium, with flexibility (an ambitious student could tackle very sophisticated new transformations, and there is also scope for focusing on addressing a series of easy, yet important, issues).
