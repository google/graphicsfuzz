# Google Summer of Code ideas for 2019

## Web-based visualization of SPIR-V

### Description

SPIR-V is an intermediate representation for programming GPUs, along the lines
of LLVM IR.

When debugging SPIR-V code or tools that operate on SPIR-V, the IR can be hard
to understand.

This project is about creating a visualization tool for SPIR-V programs,
inspired by [what the Go compiler can
do](https://pauladamsmith.com/blog/2016/08/go-1.7-ssa.html).

Possible features:

* Show the control flow graph, with some informative highlighting of the
  instructions inside nodes

* Interactive features, such as moving CFG nodes around, or clicking on an ID to
  highlight its uses

* Providing a diff view to see the effects of program
  optimizations/transformations side-by-side (like the optimizations of Go
  compiler in the article linked above)
