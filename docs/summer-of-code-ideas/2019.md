# Google Summer of Code ideas for 2019

## Web-based visualization of SPIR-V

### Description

[SPIR-V](https://www.khronos.org/registry/spir-v/) is an intermediate representation for programming GPUs, along the lines
of LLVM IR.

When debugging SPIR-V code or tools that operate on SPIR-V, the IR can be hard
to understand.

This project is about creating a visualization tool for SPIR-V programs,
inspired by [what the Go compiler can
do](https://pauladamsmith.com/blog/2016/08/go-1.7-ssa.html):

![Go visualization example](https://pauladamsmith.com/images/gossa/thumb.png)

Possible features:

* Show the control flow graph, with some informative highlighting of the
  instructions inside nodes

* Interactive features, such as moving CFG nodes around, or clicking on an ID to
  highlight its uses

* Providing a diff view to see the effects of program
  optimizations/transformations side-by-side (like the optimizations of the Go
  compiler in the article linked above)

### Required skills

* C++ programming (the existing tools for working with SPIR-V are written in C++
and you will probably need to extend these tools)
* Some familiarity with HTML and possibly JavaScript/TypeScript and/or other web technologies

Experience with compilers and thinking about control flow graphs (or just graphs) would be
useful but is not required.

## Comparative code coverage for shader compilers

The [gcov](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Gcov.html) tool reports code
coverage of a given execution of a program. The
[lcov](https://github.com/linux-test-project/lcov) tool can present the coverage
data in a web-based report:

![Lcov example](http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/lcov/screenshot2.gif)

Two executions of the same program, with different inputs, will lead to two
separate coverage reports. In the context of testing shader compilers (part of
GPU drivers), it would be great to compare the shader compiler coverage
difference when compiling two almost-identical shaders, with one of the shaders
leading to a compilation issue. Unfortunately, there does not seem to exist a
tool or an option to present the difference of two separate coverage reports of
the same program.

This project has two goals:
1. Extend lcov to generate a diff view between two code coverage reports of the same
   program.
2. Explore how the coverage difference can guide the developer to understand the root
   cause of bugs in the context of shader compilers.

The second goal will involve working with open-source shader compilers like
[Mesa](https://www.mesa3d.org/),
[SPIRV-tools](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-Tools) or
[LLPC](https://github.com/GPUOpen-Drivers/llpc).

### Required skills

* Basic HTML and CSS knowledge for lcov extension
* C/C++ programming to understand shader compiler implementations
* Interest in compilers

Experience with gcov/lcov, shader compilers would be useful but is not
required.

## Coverage-guided fuzzing for shader tools

[GraphicsFuzz](https://github.com/google/graphicsfuzz) is an automated
fuzz-testing framework for tools that operate on graphics shaders, such as
graphics drivers and graphics shader compilers.  Currently GraphicsFuzz is *black-box*:
inputs to the tool under test are generated without any information about
what code is being executed.

This project will investigate extending the GraphicsFuzz approach with
coverage-guided features, where feedback on the code executed by the tool
under test is used to inform the fuzzing process.  This has been shown to be
useful in fuzzers such as [AFL](http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/).

The project would start by considering source code coverage of some tools that
operate on shaders, such as:

* [Mesa](https://www.mesa3d.org/) open source graphics drivers
* The [SPIRV-Tools](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-Tools) collection of tools
* The [SwiftShader](https://github.com/google/swiftshader) software renderer

A stretch goal would be to use binary instrumentation to enable coverage-guided
fuzzing for closed-source graphics drivers in Android devices.

### Required skills

* C++ and Java programming
* Tweaking build systems such as CMake

Experience with the asan/msan sanitizers, shader compilers and binary instrumentation would be useful but is not required.
