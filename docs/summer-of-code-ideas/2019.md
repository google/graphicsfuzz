# Google Summer of Code ideas for 2019

## Web-based visualization of SPIR-V

### Description

[SPIR-V](https://www.khronos.org/registry/spir-v/) is an intermediate representation for programming GPUs, along the lines
of LLVM IR.

When debugging SPIR-V code or tools that operate on SPIR-V, the IR can be hard
to understand.

This project is about creating a visualization tool for SPIR-V programs,
inspired by [what the Go compiler can
do](https://pauladamsmith.com/blog/2016/08/go-1.7-ssa.html).

Possible features:

* Show the control flow graph, with some informative highlighting of the
  instructions inside nodes

* Interactive features, such as moving CFG nodes around, or clicking on an ID to
  highlight its uses

* Providing a diff view to see the effects of program
  optimizations/transformations side-by-side (like the optimizations of Go
  compiler in the article linked above)

## Coverage-guided fuzzing for shader tools

[GraphicsFuzz](https://github.com/google/graphicsfuzz) is an automated
fuzz-testing framework for tools that operate on graphics shaders, such as
graphics drivers and graphics compilers.  Currently GraphicsFuzz is *black-box*:
a shader processing tool is tested without reference to the specific code that
tool is executing.

This project will investigate extending the GraphicsFuzz approach with
coverage-guided features, where feedback on the code executed by the system
under test is used to inform the fuzzing process.  This has been shown to be
useful in fuzzers such as [AFL](http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/).

The project would start by considering source code coverage of some tools that
operate on shaders, such as:

* [Mesa](https://www.mesa3d.org/) open source graphics drivers
* The [SPIRV-Tools](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-Tools) collection of tools
* The [SwiftShader](https://github.com/google/swiftshader) software renderer

A stretch goal would be to use binary instrumentation to enable coverage-guided
fuzzing for closed-source graphics drivers in Android devices.

### Required skills

* C++ and Java programming
* Tweaking build systems such as CMake

Experience with the asan/msan sanitizers could be useful but is not required.
