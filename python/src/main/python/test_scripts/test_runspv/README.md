`run_spvtests.py` runs a series of tests that check `runspv` is behaving
correctly.

The tests assume that you are working under Linux and that an Android device is connected.

They require Python 3, Pillow, and `pytest`.  The latter can be installed as follows:

```
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
pip3 install pytest
```
