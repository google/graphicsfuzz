/*
This shader populates an floating point array with values
in reverse order, and then uses bubble sort to put the values
in the desired order.

To make things a bit more interesting, the order is based on 
the screen coordinates of the shader, so half of the screen
sorts in one order and vice versa.

The resulting data is then used to draw an image on the screen,
dividing the screen in half in another direction.

While the data being sorted is in floating point format, the
data itself consists of integer values. The image drawing uses
division to keep the values in a sane range. All of the operations
are numerically stable.
