This shader reads 3x3 texture samples and sums
them using weights, producing a box filtered version
of the texture.

Since the texture coordinates are only manipulated
at texel-integer steps, the positions inside the 
texels should be stable.

Any potential instability comes from sampling the
texture. If a rounding error causes a different
texel to be chosen (or in case of bilinear, weighted
average of various texels), the result will differ.
