This shader manipulates the UV coordinates by 
continuously scaling them up, creating smaller and
smaller versions of the texture in the output.
Since the coordinates are always multiplied by two,
the location within a texel should remain stable.

Any potential instability comes from sampling the
texture. If a rounding error causes a different
texel to be chosen (or in case of bilinear, weighted
average of various texels), the result will differ.
