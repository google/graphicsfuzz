/*
This shader generates a little maze into the local array,
and if it detects that the current pixel is part of the
maze, it exits early. Otherwise, when the whole maze
has been generated (there's nowhere to "walk" anymore),
the other color is sent out.

During each iteration, the walker (vector p) checks
the four cardinal directions whether it can take a step
in those directions. Should there be no way to move,
the whole map is checked for empty space, and should
such be found, the walker is teleported there.

If there are directions to walk to, steps are taken
with a little bit of randomness based on how many
legal moves have been possible and how many directions
may be taken. All of this is done with integer math,
so the result is deterministic.

(For different kinds of mazes, just change the
starting position of the walker.)
