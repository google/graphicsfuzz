This shader reads a texel and uses its green channel
as a height value, and then does trivial search to 
find whether some nearby texel casts a shadow on it.

Since the texture coordinates are only manipulated
at texel-integer steps, the positions inside the 
texels should be stable.

Any potential instability comes from sampling the
texture. If a rounding error causes a different
texel to be chosen (or in case of bilinear, weighted
average of various texels), the result will differ.
