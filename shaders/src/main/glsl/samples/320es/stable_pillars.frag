/*
This shader produces an old Amiga demoscene effect
in a very inefficient way.

A precalculated table of 256 integer positions is used
to see where the tops of the pillars are. For each
pixel in the output, we scan upwards to find the first
pillar top we find, and color the current pixel based on
that. If no pillar tops are found while tracing, we render
black.

Each of the pillars is considerered to be +/- 15 pixels
from the value in the table, with a gradient fill.

Apart from the gradient fill (which is a simple linear
interpolation), everything is done with integer math,
making the result deterministic.

(The original effect was produced by having a single pixel
high framebuffer and tricking the video chip to re-render
it over and over again; by drawing just the single slice
of a pillar, it would stretch downwards until overwritten).
