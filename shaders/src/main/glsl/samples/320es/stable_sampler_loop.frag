This shader repeatedly reads a texel and uses it to
calculate the next set of coordinates until an
arbituary criteria is met, in this case the sum
of the texel colors must be under 1, up to 16
iterations.

Before reading again the coordinates are normalized
to integer positions within the texture in order
to minimize rounding errors.

Any potential instability comes from sampling the
texture. If a rounding error causes a different
texel to be chosen (or in case of bilinear, weighted
average of various texels), the result will differ.
