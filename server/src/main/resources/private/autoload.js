//When going back in browser history to previous page through UI, window.name is
//set to "autoload" so that the page reloads upon arrival (as opposed to
//loading a cached version). An example is deletion of a result:
//If you start from a results page, go through to a result, and delete it,
//the browser will be redirected back to the results page. Without autoload the
//result will not appear to be deleted without refreshing the page. Autoload
//just refreshes the page for the user.

//Reloads page if window.name === "autoload"
function autoload() {
    var windowName = window.name;
    window.name = "";
    if (windowName === "autoload") {
        window.location.reload();
    }
